## Fix for LT/RT buttons doesn't work for sorting in inventory

**Disable krbr.dzip**

It overrides some gui panels and for some reason removes sorting from LT/RT buttons.

**krbr** is an extension for Korean and Brazilian language support. If you don't need this languages, you can disable this extension.

List of gui files overwritten by krbr:

- cnormalbutton.swf
- fonts_kr.swf
- ui_character.swf
- ui_crafting.swf
- ui_dialog.swf
- ui_elixirs.swf
- ui_inventory.swf
- ui_journal.swf
